# FFmpeg/FFprobe AWS Lambda layer

This is an AWS Lambda layer containing statically linked `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` binary utilities from the [`FFmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) Linux package, allowing you to convert videos and extract metadata about video files in AWS Lambda, deployable as an AWS lambda layer. It can help you get started quickly with FFmpeg inside Lambda functions.

## Use within Lambda

You can use a pre-deployed ARN: `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:145266761615:layer:ffmpeg:4` or deploy yourself -- edit Makefile to set your deployment bucket etc, then just run `make deploy`.

The binares will be in `/opt/bin/ffmpeg` and `/opt/bin/ffprobe` inside your Lambda container.

Check out the [Serverless Video Thumbnail Builder](https://github.com/effortless-serverless/s3-lambda-ffmpeg-thumbnail-builder) project for an example of how to wire this to a Lambda function.

## FFmpeg Version
